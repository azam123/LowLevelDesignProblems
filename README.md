ðŸ§© Why These Are Common in FAANG Interviews
They emphasize object-oriented design, SOLID principles, and appropriate design patterns.

Require carefully thought-out class hierarchies, relationships, and state management.

Allow candidates to discuss scalability, thread-safety, extensibility, and performance tradeoffsâ€”even at a small scale.

ðŸ—‚ Example Problem Mappings & Patterns
Problem	Key Classes	Design Patterns
Parking Lot	ParkingLot, Floor, Spot, Ticket, Vehicle	Strategy, Singleton
URL Shortener	URLShortener, URLMapping, Database	Factory, Hash mapping
Chess / Ticâ€‘Tacâ€‘Toe	Board, Piece, MoveStrategy, Game	Factory, Strategy
Text Editor	Document, Character, Style, Editor	Flyweight, Builder
Elevator System	Elevator, ElevatorController, Request	State, Singleton
Ticket Booking (movies)	Theater, Show, Seat, User, Booking	Observer, Singleton pattern

ðŸ’¡ Preparation Tips
Pick 5â€“7 core problems and practice by drawing UML diagrams and writing pseudocode.

Explain your assumptions (e.g., capacity, multi-thread safety, concurrency).

Discuss trade-offs: memory vs latency, extensibility vs simplicity.

Use design patterns intentionally but sparinglyâ€”only where they add clarity.

Iterate: start simple, then layer in advanced features like observer notifications or multi-floor extension.

This compilation reflects the most commonly asked LLD problems in FAANG-level interviews, and you'll encounter them repeatedly across platforms like GeeksforGeeks, Medium, and coding prep blogs.
